## Abstract

Impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic, gyms across the globe have either shut down or restricted total capacity. Due to this, everyone has turned to exercising at home regularly. To benefit people with their mental and physical health, we propose a wearable on-body haptic device capable of providing a holistic workout experience at home. Using granular haptic feedback, our proposed system can simulate the feeling of using actual gym equipment. We leverage flex sensors, force sensors, and vibrotactile actuators, all working in tandem to detect workout activity and trigger a granular haptic response to mirror the feedback we receive from various spring-and-pulley based gym machines. The generated granular haptic feedback also motivates free-hand workout routines. Additionally, our system simulates the rhythm of the music using vibrotactile actuators to promote endurance and a positive mood during workouts, allowing users to select from a range of predefined soundtracks, or load their own music. This will be especially useful for people with hearing impairment, who can now enjoy the rhythm of any music while working out. Overall, we have designed this system to encourage all types of people to pursue fitness and to enrich their home workout experience.

#### For Connecting Things Together
* [2-RCA Male to 3.5mm Male](https://www.amazon.com/eBoot-3-5mm-Audio-Stereo-Adapter/dp/B06XC5KWJN/) (4 count) <br>
    - **Cable Length Recommendation:** Short, approximately 6 inches in length.
* [Qwiic Cable](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14426) (2 count) <br>
    - **Cable Length Recommendation:** Extremely short, approximately 50 mm in length.
* [Ribbon Cables](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10647) <br>
    - **Cable Recommentation:** A multi-colored wire strand setup will help in cable management. <br>
    - **Cable Length Recommendation:** Extremely long, at least 30 feet long for a 10-wire pack.
* [Female Jumper Wires](https://www.amazon.com/40pcs-Female-2-54mm-Jumper-2x40pcs/dp/B00GSE2S98) (16 count) <br>
    - **Cable Length Recommendation:** As short as can be, only the connector is required with minimal wire (will be soldered to ribbon cables).
* **[OPTIONAL]** [Type-C Cable](https://www.amazon.com/Charger-Braided-Charging-Compatible-Samsung/dp/B08NX7M6MS) <br>
    - **Cable Recommentation:** This cable is required only if using a power bank or USB outlet to power Raspberry Pi. <br>
    - **Cable Length Recommendation:** Depends, approximately 2 feet if using a powerbank, otherwise as long as possible if powering through USB-outlet.
* **[OPTIONAL]** [Micro-HDMI to HDMI Cable](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/micro-hdmi-to-standard-hdmi-a-cable/) <br>
    - **Cable Recommentation:** This cable is required only if connection to monitor is required. <br>
    - **Cable Length Recommendation:** As per monitor placement.
* **[OPTIONAL]** [2x AA Battery Holder + Jumper Headers](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3858) <br>
    - **Recommentation:** This is only required to power the Syntacts board. Alternatively, a USB cable with exposed VCC and GND wires can also be used along with a power bank or USB-outlet. <br>

#### Other Electronic Components

#### Non-Electronic Components for Assembling the System
* [Knee-Length Socks](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07H2WGKVB) (at least 4 pairs)
* [Velcro Cable Ties](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001E1Y5O6) (approximately 30 pieces) <br>
    - **Recommendation:** Cable Ties and Socks are used to hold components in place. These are highly recommended, but alternatively any string with significant tensile strength can be used to tie the components on the user's body, not recommended though.
* [Band-Aid](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00ZQF0Y5K) (each setup needs approximately 10 band-aids per use, purchase accordingly) <br>
    - **Recommendation:** Band-Aids are used for holding components against the skin since they are considered as skin-safe adhesives, but alternatively regular tapes could also be used, not recommended though.
* Cardboard Box (17mm L x 11mm B x 9mm D)

#### Tools
Assembling the On-Body Gym will require the usual workshop tools which include (but may not be limited to): scissor, screw-drivers, blade, soldering kit, shrink tubes (optional, for wrapping up the soldered-joints), and a heat gun (optional, for shrinking the shrink tube). A cheaper alternative to shrink tubes and heat gun is an electrical tape, which can also be used to wrap up soldered joints.

## Step 2: Preparing the Hardware
Before we start connecting the hardware together, we need to prepare some components first.

#### Changing ADC Board I2C Address
The SparkFun 12-bit 4-channel ADC board has a default I2C address of 0x48. However, this address may conflict with other components on the Raspberry Pi board. Thankfully, the ADC board offers 3 additional I2C address to choose from (0x49, 0x4A, and 0x4B). Thus, in order to avoid an address conflict, we need to manually change the I2C address of both the ADC boards. Follow [this tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-12-bit-adc-hookup-guide/hardware-overview) (under Jumpers > I2C Address) to learn how to change I2C address of this ADC board. Based on this tutorial, first cut the connection to the 0x48 address for both the ADC boards (remember we have 2 counts of the ADC board), then make connection to address 0x49 for one of the ADC boards, and another connection to address 0x4A for the other ADC boards.

#### Disconnecting the 10kÎ© Potentiometer of the ADC Boards
The ADC boards have a 10k ohm potentiometer connected to their AIN3 ports which disturbs the sensor readings. Thus, we need to disconnect the potentiometer. Follow [this tutorial](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/qwiic-12-bit-adc-hookup-guide/hardware-overview) (under Jumpers > Potentiometer) to learn more about how to cut this potentiometer.

#### Adding Females Jumpers to the Linear Resonant Actuators
From the ribbon cable, take out 8 sets of 2-wired cables with length of at least 1 meter. Slightly peel off both ends of the cables to expose the wires. Solder one end of each of the 2-wired cable ends with a linear resonant actuator. Now, cut the female-to-female jumper wires in half, and peel off the ends of the cables to expose the wire. Now, for each of the 8 sets of 2-wired ribbon cables soldered to the linear resonant actuators, solder the other end of the cable with the jumper wires. This will result in 8 linear resonant actuator assemblies, with each actuator having two female jumpers at the end of a 1 meter long cable. If done correctly, the end result should look similar to the linear resonant actuator assembly shown [here](https://github.com/WHC2021SIC/WHC2021SIC-TeamOnBodyGym/blob/master/images/architecture/PrimaryHardware.png?raw=true).

* **Recommendation:** While taking out 8 sets of 1 meter 2-wired cables, try to take out 4 sets of 2 meter 2-wired cables first, each pair having a different color combination, and then cut these 4 sets in half to make 8 sets of 1 meter 2-wired cables. Doing this will result in each color combination have 2 sets of 1 meter 2-wired cables, which will help immensely with wire management in the later part of the build.
* **Recommendation:** It is highly recommended to use shrink tubes at the solder joints and heat it with a heat gun. This will not only protect the system from short-circuits and strengthen the overall structure of the system but will also make the system more comfortable to mount at a later stage.

#### Soldering Wires to Flex and Force Sensors
Similar to the previous step involving the linear resonant actuators, we need to add 1-meter long 2-wired cables to each of the 4 flex and 2 force sensors. However, unlike the previous step, we do not need to solder female jumpers on the other end of the cable.
* **Recommendation:** Similar to the previous stage, it is highly recommended to use shrink tubes at the solder joints and heat it with a heat gun. This will not only protect the system from short-circuits and strengthen the overall structure of the system but will also make the system more comfortable to mount at a later stage.

## Step 3: Hardwares, Assemble!
Once the hardware components are prepared, it is now finally time to assemble them!

## Step 4: Put 'em in a Box, Tie 'em with a Ribbon
Now that the hardware is assembled together, we can finally compactify the setup by putting it in a cardboard box.
